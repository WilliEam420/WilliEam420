# My old studio: DEEP SPACE
> DEEP SPACE studio has completely dissolved on April 29th, 2025.

The main function of the core database is to store my important files and data. It is used as a large-scale storage station for non-specific purposes. Therefore, the structure of the file system will be rather chaotic. However, this does not prevent it from performing its own functions as a large-scale storage station.

After the dissolution of the old DEEP SPACE studio, all the work was done by me alone. As the creator of the studio, I found that compared with teamwork, I am more suitable for working independently. Therefore, the current dissolution of the studio and the establishment of my personal database seem to be even more important.
<p align="center">DEEP SPACE studio will never exist again.</p>
